<p>Well, it really has been some time since I posted an update here, (around 2 years :S). While it may seem like I have been lazy, I have been working on a few different projects in the background(as well as raising a my 3 year old son :S). The biggest of those is being accepted into the Udacity/Google Front End Web Deveopler Challenge. This has taken up the bulk of my free time the past few months and has really been a great learning experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dTZGXR/Capture.png" alt="App" /></p>

<p>Outside of learning I have been mostly working on my just released app <a href="https://mattbudde.github.io/pomotron-website/">Pomotron</a>. It is a fairly simple Pomodoro timer built using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript using <a href="https://electronjs.org" title="Electron">https://electronjs.org</a>. There are still many things that can be improved with the app and I am by no means happy with the end result, but better to “finish” something than to have done nothing at all.</p>

<p>I plan on going over in more depth what I have learn’t through the Udcaity/Google Challenge as well as sharing some other tools that I have come across while putting together <a href="https://mattbudde.github.io/pomotron-website/">Pomotron</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I am open to suggestions surrounding future topics.</p>

	     <p>Hey! Welcome to Ghost, it’s great to have you :)</p>

<p>We know that first impressions are important, so we’ve populated your new site with some initial <strong>Getting Started</strong> posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!</p>

<h3 id="there-are-a-few-things-that-you-should-know-up-front">There are a few things that you should know up-front:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That’s who it works best for. If you’re using Ghost for some other purpose, that’s fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.</li>
  <li>The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so <strong>does</strong> require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.</li>
  <li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.</p>

<p>The main thing you’ll want to read about next is probably: <a href="https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re done reading, you can simply delete the default <strong>Ghost</strong> user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!</p>

	     <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>Welcome to my homepage dedicated to my random gibberish about tech and development. I am a self taught developer based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying to be a Full Stack Developer using <a href="https://codermanual.com/">CoderManual</a>. You can check out the fruits of this course on my <a href="http://github.com/mattbudde">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To give an insight into how this self-taught process goes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. - George Carrette</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above sums up the majority of my development process, as showcased by this lovely jekyll theme by <a href="https://github.com/renyuanz">Renyuanz</a>. My aim is obviously, to become a “Full Fledged” developer and eventually turn this into my career.</p>

<p>With that said, stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Matt</p>
