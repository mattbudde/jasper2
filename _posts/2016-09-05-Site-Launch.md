## Welcome

Hi there. 

Welcome to my homepage dedicated to my random gibberish about tech and development. I am a self taught developer based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am currently studying to be a Full Stack Developer using [CoderManual](https://codermanual.com/). You can check out the fruits of this course on my [GitHub](http://github.com/mattbudde).

To give an insight into how this self-taught process goes,

> First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. - George Carrette

The above sums up the majority of my development process, as showcased by this lovely jekyll theme by [Renyuanz](https://github.com/renyuanz). My aim is obviously, to become a "Full Fledged" developer and eventually turn this into my career.

With that said, stay tuned for more.

Matt
