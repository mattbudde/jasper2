## Blog Update and My First App Release

Well, it really has been some time since I posted an update here, (around 2 years :S). While it may seem like I have been lazy, I have been working on a few different projects in the background(as well as raising a my 3 year old son :S). The biggest of those is being accepted into the Udacity/Google Front End Web Deveopler Challenge. This has taken up the bulk of my free time the past few months and has really been a great learning experience.

Outside of learning I have been mostly working on my just released app [Pomotron](https://mattbudde.github.io/pomotron-website/). It is a fairly simple Pomodoro timer built using HTML, CSS & Javascript using [https://electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org "Electron"). There are still many things that can be improved with the app and I am by no means happy with the end result, but better to "finish" something than to have done nothing at all. 

I plan on going over in more depth what I have learn't through the Udcaity/Google Challenge as well as sharing some other tools that I have come across while putting together [Pomotron](https://mattbudde.github.io/pomotron-website/).

As always, I am open to suggestions surrounding future topics.
